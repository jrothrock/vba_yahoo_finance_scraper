# VBA Yahoo Finance Scraper

** Note, this will only work on Windows due to needing ActiveX **

** Also, this will only work on 32bit office products, as MSScriptControl.Scriptcontrol was removed from 64bit products. **

## How It Works

On the input sheet, a user enters the stock in to the text field and when the 'get stock info' button gets clicked, VBA will scrape Yahoo finance for historical prices, and will create a 30 day chart of the prices for that stock. It will also create another sheet showing common financial information for said stock.
